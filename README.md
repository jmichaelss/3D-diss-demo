# Simple 3D Object Inspector

This project is a demo of using 3D graphics to visualize and interact with data. The project utilizes the Three.js and X3DOM libraries to render 3D content in the browser.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports Three.js and X3DOM (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Running the demo

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `threejs.html` file in your web browser with a live server extension.
3. The 3D data visualization should load and be displayed in the browser. You can interact with the visualization using your mouse or touch input.

## Customizing the visualization

To customize the visualization, you can modify the `3.js` file and change the 3D object data that is included.

## File structure

The project has the following file structure:

```
